# ESBL-Java-Projects-from-Trairak  
This repository contains Java programs developed by Trairak Pisitkun for NHLBI/NIH.  

## Projects  
- AbDesigner: a tool that helps identify optimal immunizing peptides for the production of antibodies
- AbDesigner3D: a structure-guided tool that integrates 3D structural data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with UniProt data to identify optimal immunizing peptides for antibody production.
- Automated Bioinformatics Extractor (ABE): a batch tool for extraction of specified information about specific proteins from UniProt or RefSeq protein records.
- CPhos: an information theory-based algorithm to assess the conservation of phosphorylation sites among species.
- Renal Inner Medulla Free-Energy Calculator: a tool for calculation of net free energy change in steady-state models of the renal concentrating mechanism.
- KinaseMotifClassifier: a tool that identifies and categorizes kinase-specific motifs from phosphopeptide sequences into categories such as "basic," "acidic," or "proline-directed."
- PhosphoLogo: a tool for generating information-based sequence logos from a list of equal-length peptide sequences surrounding a phosphorylated residue.
- ProteinMatcher (ProMatch): a program to match peptide and mRNA sequences to entries in the NCBI Reference Sequence Database (RefSeq).
- PTM Centralizer: converts MS-identified peptides containing a specific feature (e.g., a phosphorylation site) to a sequence of a given length with the feature in the center.
- Temporal Pattern Mining (TPM) algorithm: clusters time-series data sets according to time-course pattern.
